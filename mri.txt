Image segmentation where regions of interest are delineated is necessary for performing subsequent quantitative analysis and qualitative visualization. Segmentation is the process of splitting an image into parts having strong correlation with areas of interest in the image. The goal of segmentation is to simplify or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. There are a number of techniques to segment an image into regions that are homogeneous. Not all the techniques are suitable for medical image analysis because of complexity and inaccuracy. There is no standard image segmentation technique that can produce satisfactory results for all imaging applications like brain MRI, brain cancer diagnosis etc. Optimal selection of features, tissues, brain and nonâ€“brain elements are considered as main obstacles for brain image segmentation. In the field of medical image processing segmentation of MR brain image is significant as MRI is particularly suitable for brain studies because of its excellent contrast of soft issues, non-invasive characteristic and a high spatial resolution. Many segmentation techniques such as mean shift, region growing, water shed, graph cuts, fuzzy connectivity etc. are available for medical imaging especially for brain MRI
